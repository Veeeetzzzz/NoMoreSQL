# Other notes

Not designed for commercial or production use. This work is very much a proof of concept and has been configured to run on a local server. 

For commercial usage, please refer to the license below & and choose a production-ready WSGI server. Popular options are Gunicorn and uWSGI.

There will be bugs. Although this is an improvement over OpenAI alone, sometimes it gets things wrong. 

Please feel free to contribute by raising an issue or pull request. Unfortunately I can't guarentee the stability or future development plans and the code is provided on an as-is basis with no promises.
